/*
You manage a travel agency and you want your n drivers to input their following details:
1. Name
2. Driving License No
3. Route
4. Kms
Your program should be able to take n as input(or you can take n=3 for simplicity) and your drivers will start inputting their details one by one.

Your program should print details of the drivers in a beautiful fashion.
User structures.
